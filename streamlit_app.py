### Net Present Value (NPV)

**Definition**  
*Netâ€¯Presentâ€¯Value* is the value **today** of a series of future cash flows after each one is discounted by a chosen rate (e.g. inflation or required return).  
For liabilities like studentâ€‘loan repayments, the plan with the **lower NPV** is cheaper in today's money. The default discount rate is 2â€¯% (e.g. UK inflation target).

**Formula**

$$
\text{NPV} \;=\; \sum_{t=0}^{T} \frac{C_t}{(1 + r)^{t}}
$$

where&nbsp;  
\(C_t\)â€¯=â€¯cashÂ flow at timeâ€¯\(t\) (negativeÂ = payment, positiveÂ = income)  
\(r\)â€¯=â€¯discount rate (e.g. 2â€¯% inflation â‡’Â 0.02)  
\(T\)â€¯=â€¯final period in years (or months) being analysed
